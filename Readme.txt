Run python script logcreator.py 
-- it will create data/logfile.txt and js/csvfile.js (logfile.txt asked log file in required format)

Run analysis.html on browser, it will take js/csvfile.js as an input and shows per minute analytics of "OK||TEMP||PERM" status.

For third extra point case, I have used hadoop mapreduce framework. 
Hadoop environment needs to be installed to run this program successfully.
WordCount java project has all the required dependecies, run from any java ide to see the results in output folder.

Put data/logfile.txt in input folder of the WordCount java project.
Current output is stored in output folder of the project.
