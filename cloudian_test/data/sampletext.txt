Object Storage Overview
Object storage is a requisite cornerstone of today's Internet scale applications. 
It is an evolution of traditional block storage, which manages data as blocks and file storage, which manages data as a file hierarchy. 
Object storage systems manage data as objects in a flat organization of containers (buckets) and use globally unique identifier (key) to retrieve it. 
Each object typically includes variable amount of metadata allowing object storage system to scale out almost endlessly by simply adding nodes to the infrastructure.
Object storage systems allow cost effective, scalable and self-healing retention of massive amounts of unstructured data. 
Advanced object storage solutions also come with services based, distributed, redundant, commodity principles of the cloud applied.
For example, object storage is used to build Storage as a Service (StaaS) and to provide secondary storage for cloud compute platforms. Cloudian HyperStore object storage software
